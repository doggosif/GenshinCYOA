                <p>You decide to take the route to the region of Sumeru, but before you leave, Tartaglia asks you for a
                    favor. You reluctantly accept and follow him a few miles outside of Liyue Harbor. You enter the
                    Golden House, a vast room full of Mora kept by the bank, and Tartaglia draws his weapon against you.
                    "C'mon, lets duel for old time sake," he says. Seeing that there's no refusing, you draw your
                    weapon. You fight him will all the skills you have, and right when you thought you defeated him, he
                    reveals his true, shocking form. You take a few good hits, but with perseverance, Tartaglia is
                    defeated. "I will grow stronger than you one day, just you wait..." he groans. You walk out the
                    Golden House and make your way to the Chasm, the only way to the region of Sumeru.
