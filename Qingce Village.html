                <p>You trek down the rocky path, and it's quiet and peaceful. You pass by small ruins and bamboo
                    forests, until you finish the climb and see vast croplands. Above them is a quaint village. The
                    villagers welcome you and show you around. "Mighty Mt. Qingce gently cradles this peaceful village,
                    silently protecting the old, the young, and the abundant croplands within its embrace. The legend of
                    the ancient threat subdued beneath the mountain has been consigned to legend along with those who
                    know of it, never again to return," one of the villagers explain. The huge mountain acts like an
                    impenetrable wall protecting the village, and it seems like there's no where else to go. You enjoy
                    the rest of your break in this village, enjoying the Liyue countryside and local specialties.</p>
