                <p>When you leave the trade center, you see the path to Inazuma City cuts through rolling plains. It's a
                    peaceful hike, and after an hour, you reach the suburbs of Inazuma City. You meet old friends like
                    Yoimiya, Kazuha, and Ayaka, enjoy a good light novel from Yae Miko's book store, and eat the local
                    cuisine the region has to offer. These are the final moments of your journey, and you enjoy them all that you can.
