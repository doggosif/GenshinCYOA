                <p>You continue on the path with Diluc, and after a short walk from the manor, you encounter hostile
                    Cryo Slimes. A perfect opportunity for Diluc to show off his Pyro Vision, he swings his fiery
                    greatsword. You continue forward, along the path is a flowing river, cutting through a canyon. "This
                    is the canyon that divides the regions of Mondstat and Liyue. It's fittingly called the Stone Gate.
                    Once this river ends, you will no
                    longer be in Mondstat," Diluc says. You continue through the canyon for an hour, and at the end, the
                    beautiful lands of Liyue appear. Diluc bids farewell, and you ponder what path you take next. To the
                    left, you see a huge treehouse in the middle of an estuary, and to the right is a mountainous path
                    you are unfamiliar with. Which path do you take?</p>
