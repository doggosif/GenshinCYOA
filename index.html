                <p>Welcome to the world of Teyvat traveler, a vast world full of magic and wonder. You arrived here from
                    another world, and it didn't take long for you to make friends, help cities and villages, defend the
                    world from deadly threats, and encounter gods. With the ability to control the seven elements of
                    Teyvat, you have made your mark on this world, and everyone is indebted to you. You've lived here
                    for a while now, and after many
                    years of difficult tasks, you've decided
                    to take a break and explore the world without any worries or responsibilities.</p>
