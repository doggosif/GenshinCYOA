                <p>The path ahead of you is strikingly clear, as the big tree house in the middle of an estuary is a
                    landmark you cannot miss. As you trek across the marshy lands, you finally arrive, and realize that
                    this is the world famous Wangshu Inn. The innkeeper recognizes you for your heroic deeds of the
                    past, and offers you the best room on the house. You accept and take a needed rest. In the
                    restaurant, you meet a familiar face. It's Tartaglia, the 11th Harbinger from Snezhnaya, and your
                    old rival. You two catch up over dinner, and he offers to accompany you on the path to Liyue Harbor.
                    You think on that idea, and go to sleep for the night. Which path will you take the next morning? To
                    the left leads to Liyue Harbor, and to the right is more unfamiliar lands.
