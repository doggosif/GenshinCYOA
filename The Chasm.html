                <p>After your intense fight with Tartaglia, you make your way to The Chasm, a mining facility that has
                    been closed off due to unforseen dangers in the region. The entrance is guarded to keep outsiders
                    away, and they refuse to let you in. After some arguing with the guards, a familiar face appears.
                    "Let her in, she can handle herself quite well," she says. It's Yelan, a secret agent of the
                    Ministry of Affairs. You're glad to see each other, and Yelan offers to guide you through the Chasm.
                    You accept and move forward. After an hour of hiking through the rocky mines, a group of bandits
                    stop you in your tracks. With Yelan's Hydro Vision, she takes them out with quick speed. Further
                    ahead, you enter a cave, and inside it guards a Geovishap. After a tough fight, you barely manage to
                    defeat it. Growing weary of this dangerous path, after a few more hours of hiking, you encounter
                    another group of bandits on the top of a scaffolding. With little energy to fight, you jump off and
                    glide away, barely able to make it out. You reach another cave, and Yelan stops you. "Past this
                    point, you will be in the region of Sumeru. I wish you best of luck." She dissapears, and you continue onward.
