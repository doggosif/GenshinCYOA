                <p>The climb up the Grand Narukami Shrine is known to be grueling, but you go anyway. You look up at the
                    base of the mountain, take a deep breath, and proceed forward. As you climb higher, you notice the
                    rock formations start floating in mid-air, suspended by pockets of energy. You take an Electrogranum
                    and teleport from rock to rock. Eventually, you reach the top, and the shrine is revealed to you.
                    The sacred tree shaped like a fox is as beautiful as ever. You look out at the distance, and realize
                    you've hit the end of your journey, and enjoy your last moments with it.
