                <p>Your journey begins in Mondstat, the City of Wind. As the acting grandmaster of the Knights of
                    Favonious, Jean, famously says; "The wind will carry Dandelion Seeds, songs, and stories far afield,
                    and it also guides gentle travelers to it's realm." You've stayed a few nights at Angel's Share
                    Tavern, enjoying the local food and drink the region has to offer, especially the world famous wines
                    produced at the Dawn Winery. Who knows, one day you could visit the vinyards there yourself. You
                    take a few shots with the cavalry leader, Kaeya, visit Lisa at the Grand Library, and listen to one
                    of Barbara's performances at the Favonious Cathedral. Time flies when you're having fun, but it was
                    time for you to head out. You pass the large gate to leave the city, and cross the bridge. Two paths
                    are in front of you. To the left, you see a vast, grassy meadow. To the right, you see the path
                    leads to a small forest, with some small houses peering behind the trees. Which path do you take?</p>
