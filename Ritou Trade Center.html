                <p>You decide to visit the islands of Inazuma, but you need a ship to cross the sea. You visit Captain
                    Beidou's ship, a friend of yours that you know can help you. She happily accepts and you sail the
                    stormy seas. After a few days, you arrive at Ritou Trade Center, a place where merchants from all
                    over Teyvat trade their good with the Inazuma locals. From here, you have two paths to take. The
                    left path takes you to to the Grand Narukami Shrine, and to the right takes you to Inazuma City.
