                <p>As you continue down the path, the air turns chilly, and the ground grows paler with patches of snow.
                    You approach a small camp of researchers. They tell you that beyond the path is Dragonspine, a huge
                    mountain full of dangers. A familiar researcher approaches you and offers to help, insisting that he
                    is very familiar with the path ahead. It's Albedo, the famous alchemist of Mondstat. You and Eula
                    agree, and continue up the path. After a few hours of hiking up the mountain, you encounter a group
                    of hostile Hilichurls. With Eula and Albedo's combat prowess, you were able to dispatch anything in
                    your way. You glide past a broken bridge and approach one of Albedo's research hideouts, and camp
                    out for the night. The next morning, you continue across the cold mountain, and after a few more
                    hours of hiking, a Frostarm Lawachurl blocks your path. The fight grows fierce, but eventually you
                    all down the beast. As the hours start to feel longer, and your energy is waning, you finally cross
                    the dangerous mountain path of Dragonspine, and see a grassy clearing up ahead. Eula and Albedo part
                    ways and you thank them for the company.</p>
