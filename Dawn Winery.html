                <p>As you pass the forest, you approach a small town. You see a sign that says; "Springvale, The Land of
                    Clear Springs." A local villager gives you a warm welcome, and gives you a small tour. "A peaceful
                    and idyllic suburban town. It has a long history of hunting, of sweet spring water, and of passing
                    down the legend of a beneficent spirit dwelling within the waters," he tells you. You thank him for
                    his hospitality and continue on your journey. It's a very peaceful walk through the forest, with the
                    sun shining, cool breeze, and the theraputic sounds of nature. As you cut through the trees, you
                    spot a grand manor, and vast vinyards beside it. The maids welcome you inside, and you meet a
                    familiar face. It's Diluc, an ex-knight of Favonious, and owner of the Dawn Winery. You two have a
                    conversation over some of the winery's famous wines, as it's been a while since you last met. You
                    tell him about the journey you're on, and he offers to temporarily accompany you until you reach the
                    region of Liyue. You accept, and move on.</p>
