                <p>A vast meadow of grass is revealed to you as you take the left path. In the center of it all is a
                    monumental tree. Legends say it was left behind by an ancient heroin, who freed the region from a
                    turmoil of a tyrant. As you continue down the path, you climb a small hill, and approach a ravine.
                    At the base of the entrance is Eula, one of the Knights of Favonious, and scout of the region.
                    You're small acquaintances with each other. Eula warns it's dangerous to go further down this path,
                    and offers to help you. You welcome her company and proceed further down. After going through the
                    ravine, you see a field of swords, all piercing the dirt. You approach a monument that reads the
                    following; "Hundreds of years have passed, and the
                    world is once again at peace. This forest of blades stands as testament to the song of clashing
                    swords, the battle-hymns of warriors, the thundering footfalls of monsters, and the crimson sky, as
                    red as blood."</p>
