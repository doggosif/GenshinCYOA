                <p>When you exit the cave, you see a lushious jungle. You are now in the region of Sumeru. A special
                    plant here allows you to glide through the landscape easily. After a few more hours of hiking, you
                    see a beautiful landscape, and a massive tree housing a huge, lively city. This is Sumeru City, and
                    you're glad you're here. You spend the rest of your break enjoying what Sumeru has to offer.
