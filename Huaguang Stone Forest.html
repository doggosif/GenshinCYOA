                <p>The next morning, you tell Tartaglia that you will not be going to Liyue Harbor, and that you will
                    carve your own path into the more unfamiliar parts of Liyue. He bids you farewell and you head off.
                    You pass by the vast Guili Plains, and far into the distance, you see vast mountains, and the famous
                    Huaguang Stone Forest. Excited to finally get the chance to visit this landmark, you continue down
                    the path. After a few hours of hiking, you realize that you are at the base of the mountain. You
                    notice a lonely little house, and another familiar face is enjoying some tea on the porch. It's
                    Xiao, a Yaksha Adeptus, one of the immortal defenders of Liyue, also heralded as the "Conqueror of
                    Demons." You've fought side by side with him some time ago, and while he tries to keep his
                    stone-cold persona, you know he has a warm heart. He offers to help you further up the path, and you
                    accept. As you climb the mountain, you are attacked by a group of Hilichurls. Xiao effortlessly
                    defeats them, as you watch him use his godly powers. After a long hike up the steep mountain, you
                    finally reach the Huaguang Stone Forest. "These stone spires poke out of the clouds like great
                    pavilions. Though this place is forbidden to mortal steps, such a beauteous sight is bound to
                    attract the eyes of those who yearn for the sky, and for those who dwell in adepti realms." You
                    spend the rest of your break camping out and gazing at the beauty of its landscape.
