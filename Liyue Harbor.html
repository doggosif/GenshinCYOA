                <p>The next morning, you leave to Liyue Harbor with Tartaglia along side. Recalling From your previous
                    travels, the path is quite simple just
                    at a glance, just cut through the Guili Plains until you reach a natural stone arc, and you should
                    see the harbor from there. The Guili Plains are known for their abundant ruins, and as you pass by
                    them, Tartaglia explains their history. "Once, this was a thriving city where a certain flower
                    bloomed in abundance. But all dreams must turn to waking. This earthly paradise was consumed by war,
                    and those who gathered here were once again scattered," he says. Your conversation is shortly
                    interrupted by a group of Hilichurls. You and Tartaglia work together and make short work of them.
                    You continue to hike for a few more hours, and after you reach the stone arch, you see Liyue Harbor
                    clear as day. You visited this grand city many times and are familiar with its locales. You catch up
                    with some friends like Ganyu and Kequing, and then ponder on your next destination. You could take
                    Captain Beidou's ship to the islands of Inazuma, or you could take the path to the jungles of Sumeru.
